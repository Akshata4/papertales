## 🌟 Inspiration
Every day, thousands of research papers are published — but most remain unread outside academia.  
I wanted to make complex research **accessible and engaging** for everyone.  
While reading *“Deep Learning within Tabular Data: Foundations, Challenges, Advances, and Future Directions”* (Ren et al., 2025), I realized Comet could help bridge this gap by turning dense papers into human-readable stories.

## 🚀 What is PaperTales?
**PaperTales** is an AI-powered storytelling workflow built using **Perplexity Comet**.  
It helps students, creators, and researchers:
1. **Summarize** academic papers using Comet’s contextual AI.  
2. **Extract** insights, key equations, and real-world implications.  
3. **Transform** them into clear, story-driven Medium articles.  
4. **Publish** and share readable knowledge with everyone.

### 🧩 Core Flow
Research Paper → Comet AI Summarization → Story Generation → Medium Article


---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Open an academic paper (e.g., on arXiv) in Comet.  
2. Use structured prompts to summarize and reframe it.  
3. Generate analogies, real-world examples, and human-friendly narratives.  
4. Export to Markdown and publish on Medium.

### Example Prompt
> “Summarize this paper in plain English and rewrite it as a story for Medium readers.  
> Include key insights, analogies, and a short conclusion.”
